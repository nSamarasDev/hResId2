Yarn for Distaff Day
We're showcasing gorgeous soft wool and mohair yarn because today is Distaff Day, a celebration that dates back to medieval times. Truth be told, we're not convinced that it's really cause for celebration, since it marked women's return to spinning work after Christmas, following 12 blissful, chore-free days.

The distaff is a tool that predates the invention of the spinning wheel. It holds wool neatly in place before it's spun on the spindle. Distaff Day symbolizes women's vital role in producing textiles for their communities and, just like the distaff, keeping everything in order and running smoothly

The distaff is a tool that predates the invention of the spinning wheel in 1533, and it holds wool neatly in place before it's spun on the spindle. January 7 is Distaff Day, an event dating back to medieval times when women went back to work spinning yarn after the Christmas holidays.

A distaff (/ˈdɪstɑːf/, /ˈdɪstæf/, also called a rock[1]), is a tool used in spinning. It is designed to hold the unspun fibers, keeping them untangled and thus easing the spinning process. It is most commonly used to hold flax and sometimes wool, but can be used for any type of fibre. Fiber is wrapped around the distaff and tied in place with a piece of ribbon or string. The word comes from Low German dis, meaning a bunch of flax, connected with staff.

As an adjective, the term distaff is used to describe the female side of a family. The corresponding term for the male side of a family is the "spear" side.
