Silver-studded blue butterflies
The butterfly effect is a scientific concept coined 50 years ago today, and it has become a literary and metaphorical term to describe the idea that the smallest change may have massive, worldwide implications. It is often associated with chaos theory. American mathematician and meteorologist Edward Norton Lorenz theorized that the flapping of a butterfly's wings, like those of the silver-studded blue butterflies you see in today's image, could weeks later influence the formation of a tornado

Europeâ€‰50% got this right B:
The silver-studded blue butterfly is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and a member of the family Lycaenidae.

The silver-studded blue (Plebejus argus) is a butterfly in the family Lycaenidae. It has bright blue wings rimmed in black with white edges and silver spots on its hindwings, lending it the name of the silver-studded blue. P. argus can be found across Europe and east across the Palearctic, but is most often studied in the United Kingdom in which the species has experienced a severe decline in population due to habitat loss and fragmentation.[1]

P. argus engages in mutualism with ants that contribute to the butterflies' reproductive fitness by providing protection from predation and parasitism from the point of egg laying to their emergence as adults.[2][3] P. argus adults emerge in the end of June and beginning of July and engage in flight into the beginning of August.[1][4]

The butterfly is adaptable to different habitats and is found in heathland, mossland, and limestone grassland.[1][5] Tending towards a sedentary lifestyle and typically flying less than 20 metres (66 ft) a day, P. argus maintains a small radius home range.[6] Their habitats lend themselves well to both foraging and egg laying as the host plants are ubiquitous in all three environments they occupy.[6][1]
