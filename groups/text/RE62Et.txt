Black Fell in England's Lake District
Today's lovely landscape requires a slight bit of explanation. We're at Black Fell, which can be found in the Lake District of England. The term 'fell' originates from the Old Norse term for mountain, but it mostly applies to high, barren areas and, in the Lake District specifically, the area was usually uncultivated and used for grazing. Black Fell, which is a little over 1,000 feet high, has some acclaim, having been mentioned in Alfred Wainwright's 'Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells' as a prime viewing area. No matter which direction you gaze, you're sure to see something wonderful

A fell (from Old Norse fell, fjall, "mountain"[1]) is a high and barren landscape feature, such as a mountain or moor-covered hill. The term is most often employed in Fennoscandia, Iceland, the Isle of Man, parts of northern England, and Scotland.
