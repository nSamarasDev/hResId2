Atrani, Amalfi Coast, Italy
With its red clay roofs and pastel buildings Atrani shines above a sparkling sea on the Amalfi Coast in southwest Italy. Just 800 people get to call Atrani home, the rest of us can only hope to visit one of the country's smallest towns, walking its narrow roads as we admire the small houses perched above the beach. The traditional fishing village is part of the Costiera Amalfitana UNESCO World Heritage Site, and it has kept its traditional characteristics alive. It is a perfect Mediterranean getaway to soak up the sun and enjoy local seafood at a waterfront cafe.

The Amalfi Coast is a 30-mile stretch of coastline that is home to some of the most stunning scenery in Italy.

The Amalfi Coast (Italian: Costiera amalfitana) is a stretch of coastline in southern Italy overlooking the Tyrrhenian Sea and the Gulf of Salerno. It is located south of the Sorrentine Peninsula and north of the Cilentan Coast.

Celebrated worldwide for its Mediterranean landscape and natural diversity, the Coast is named after the town of Amalfi, which makes up its main historical and political centre. It is a very popular jet set destination, and has been an attraction to upper-class Europeans since the 18th century, when it was a frequent stopover on their Grand Tours. Attracting international tourists of all classes annually,[1] the Amalfi Coast was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997.[2]
