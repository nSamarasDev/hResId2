Eben Ice Caves, Upper Peninsula, Michigan
The Eben Ice Caves only exist during the freezing winters of Michigan's Upper Peninsula. For the rest of the year, there are only sandstone cliffs and cedar trees here. But when temperatures drop, water flows over the canyon cliffs and turns into these beautiful, colorful ice formations.

Visitors can walk through the space created between the cliffs and the walls of ice that stretch up to 50 feet high. Make sure to bring your crampons or hiking boots and look out for the local wildlife! Only 3% of Michigan's human population lives in the Upper Peninsula, but the area is teeming with bears, moose, wolves and other animals.

Water freezes and turns from liquid to solid at 32° Fahrenheit.

Freezing is a phase transition where a liquid turns into a solid when its temperature is lowered below its freezing point. In accordance with the internationally established definition, freezing means the solidification phase change of a liquid or the liquid content of a substance, usually due to cooling.[1][2]

For most substances, the melting and freezing points are the same temperature; however, certain substances possess differing solid-liquid transition temperatures. For example, agar displays a hysteresis in its melting point and freezing point. It melts at 85 °C (185 °F) and solidifies from 32 °C to 40 °C (89.6 °F to 104 °F).[3]
