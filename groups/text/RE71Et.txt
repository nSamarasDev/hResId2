Aura River in Turku, Finland
The Turku Cathedral rises above the frosted forests near the mouth of the Aura River, which runs through the middle of Turku, Finland.

Originally built out of wood in the late 13th century, the cathedral was expanded in the 14th and 15th centuries, mainly using stone as construction material. Despite this, it was badly damaged in the Great Fire of Turku, which consumed much of the city in 1827. The cathedral was rebuilt over the next few years.

The Aura flows past several cities in Finland, but before it empties into the Baltic Sea, it passes through Turku. In the center of our photo stands Turku Cathedral.

The Aura River (Finnish Aurajoki; Swedish Aura å) is a river in south-western Finland. Its sources are in Oripää, and it flows through Pöytyä, Aura and Lieto before discharging into the Archipelago Sea in the middle of the city of Turku. The waters of the Aura river are brown. The total length of the river is about 70 kilometres (43 mi), and it contains eleven rapids, the biggest of which is Nautelankoski at Lieto. The reserve tap water for Turku Region is drawn from the Aura, the city's secondary waterworks being situated by the Halinen rapids.[1]

The word "Aura" appears to come from an archaic Swedish word for waterway (aathra, which is still current in the form ådra), but in Finnish it translates as "plough," a name the river lives up to.[2] Situated in an agricultural zone, it is made turbid by surface runoff from nearby farms with eutrophication as the biggest threat. Its condition has been improving since the 1970s and the Aura river is now clean enough to support salmon.

The banks of the river have been inhabited for at least 6,000 years. The area is notable for the cultural heritage in Finland. The archdiocese of Finland has been situated near the river since the thirteenth century.
