# hiResImageDump 2

As of 12/12/2022
This repository has been Updated and Changed.
I'm trying to get these images paired together as much as possible, it's a difficult task when there are so many.

12/17/2022
Eventaully I'm going to start putting up the new paired collection that has a nice text file that describes what the images are in detail.  I will be sure to notify wen this repository gets created. 

This is my repo for some high res images I've been collecting
over time and this repo will grow and hopefully be useful.  
updates should be regular check back often.
